		<h2>Hello You!!!!!</h2>
		<p> Hi my name is Andrea! I'm a student in the University of Saint Denis. I'm currently studying Information technology. I don't know what to say more in this introduction page so i provided photos of different stuffs that will allow you to know me more!</p>
		<p> <h3>My guitars</h3><i>I currently have four guitars. My acoustic one that i often use when i do a jamming session with my cousins, my bass that i rarely use, my guitalele, given by a very special person, so that i'm able to play guitar anywhere i go (it's perfect for travelling!), and of course, my electric one that i use to play with my friends, to chill when i'm bored, used for slaying solos to feel cool sometimes! </i><br><br>

		<p> <h3>Paris</h3><i>I love Paris! I love to wander around the city. There's literally everything!!! You'll always find a place you can go depending on your mood, if you wanna get crazy, if you want to chill, if you want to think about life, if you want to have a chitchat with your friend, if you want to have romantic moments, you'll always find the area that suits your mood! Paris, for me, will always be a special place. I've spent so many good memories here with my loved ones that allowed me to establish a deeper relationship with them. </i><br><br>
